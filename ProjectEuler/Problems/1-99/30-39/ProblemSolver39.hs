Problem description - Integer right triangles
---------------------------------------------
If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c},
there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}
For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?

Problem analysis
----------------
- The perimeter p for a triangle {a, b, c} is p = a + b + c
- Use the Pythagorean theorem to force the triangle is a right angle triangle.
- Because of a^2 + b^2 = c^2 and p = a + b + c
  -> When a and b are odd, then c is even and also p is even.
  -> When a is even and b is odd, then c will be odd and p is even.
  -> When a is odd and b is even, then c will be odd and p even.
  -> When both a and b are even, then c and p are even.
  So we only have to look for even values of p.
