Problem description - Pandigital products
-----------------------------------------
We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once;
for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.
The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and
product is 1 through 9 pandigital.
Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through
9 pandigital.
HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum.

Problem analysis
----------------
- For x * y = z wat is the upper limit for x and y? An insane boundary would be 987.654.321, this can't
  be computed.
- How can we divide 9 items into 3 buckets where ordering is relevant? Generate all permutations of the
  9 items and then per item create all possible partitions.
